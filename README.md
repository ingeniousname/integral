Numerical methods project

An university project about calculating integrals. Implemented function calculates

$\int\int f(x, y)\, dx\, dy$

over a region defined by $|x| + |y| \leq 1$. The region is first divided into $4n^2$ congruent triangles and then a third-order quadrature is applied to each of them.

Details explained in P1Z51_* file (POLISH).

Program developed in MATLAB environment.
